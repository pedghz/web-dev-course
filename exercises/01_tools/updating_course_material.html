  <h2>Prelude</h2>
  <blockquote>"To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you." -<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes">Working with Remotes on Pro Git book</a></blockquote>

      <p>These instructions guide you through the process of updating the course material in your repository to the latest version. The latest version will contain new material as well as corrections to the previously released material.</p>

      <p><code>git</code> has a concept of branches with the main idea being that there might be multiple versions of the same repository with differing contents. If you login to GitLab and browse your project and the public one (<a href="https://gitlab.rd.tut.fi/seitti/seitti2017">seitti/seitti2017</a>) the contents will be (slightly) different. Your repository hopefully has your own commits where you've solved the exercises. And the public material might have some corrections which are not yet in your repository.</p>

      <p>First you will set up the public material as remote (this is only done once) then you will <code>fetch</code> the updates from there. After that you are ready to <code>merge</code> those updates to your repository.</p>

        <li>Make sure you have committed all changes and you are on branch master</li>
        <li>Add the remote as upstream: <code>git remote add upstream git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:seitti/seitti2017.git</code></li>
        <li>Merge upstream changes with <code>git pull upstream master</code></li>
        <li>Push the changes to your GitLab repository (<code>git push</code> as usual)
      </ol>

  <h2>Working with remotes<br/><small>... or how to get the latest course material</small></h2>
  <p>Before you start this process you should have all your changes committed and no modified files in the project with non-staged commits. You can check this with <code>git status</code></p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git status</strong>
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean</pre>

  <p class="alert alert-warning">If you do not get the message about working directory being clean. You should first resolve that before continuing, otherwise you might run into problems later on.</p>

  <p>Before you start you can check that you have your own repository marked as 'origin'.</p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git remote -v</strong>
origin  git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:YOUR_TUT_GITLAB_USERNAME/seitti2017.git (fetch)
origin  git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:YOUR_TUT_GITLAB_USERNAME/seitti2017.git (push)</pre>

  <p>Next you will need to add the public course material repository as 'upstream'.</p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git remote add upstream git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:seitti/seitti2017.git</strong>
  </pre>
  <p>In your list your remotes you should now see your own repository in Gitlab (marked as 'origin') and the official material repository marked as 'upstream'</p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git remote -v</strong>
origin  git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:YOUR_TUT_GITLAB_USERNAME/seitti2017.git (fetch)
origin  git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:YOUR_TUT_GITLAB_USERNAME/seitti2017.git (push)
upstream  git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:seitti/seitti2017.git (fetch)
upstream  git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:seitti/seitti2017.git (push)</pre>
  <p class="alert alert-warning">Notice that you only need to add the remote once, after this you can pull new updates whenever you like with the following instructions</p>
  <p>Next you will incorporate the latest changes to the official repository, this is done with <code>git pull</code> command.
  <pre>
$ <strong>git pull upstream master</strong>
remote: Counting objects: 42, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (35/35), done.
remote: Total 35 (delta 21), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (35/35), done.

$</pre>
  <p>You can see what has changed by with the <code>git log</code> command. What you see is latest first list of commits on the material repository.</p>

    <p>Finally you need to push your changes to Gitlab, in the same way you've done with exercises previously with <code>git push</code>.</p>
