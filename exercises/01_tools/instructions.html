      This exercise is meant as a gentle introduction to the git workflow
      used during this course. You will learn how to clone your git project
      to a computer, edit a file, <em>add those edits</em>, commit your changes
      and finally push them to your repository at GitLab. We check the
      exercises/01_tools/hello.html in your GitLab repository and expect to
      see the following changes (editing the file is easiest part of this
      exercise):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Document hello.html will be valid html5</li>
      <li>Content of the meta element with the name of author will be changed</li>
      <li>Content of em with the id of signature will be changed</li>
      <li>The changed meta and #id will be the same</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Detailed instructions</h2>

	<h3>1. Installing git</h3>
  <p>
    Many modern Linux or OS X systems have git installed by default.
		This is the case for example in the Paniikki computer lab.
		You can search for "terminal" program
		in your system and test your installation by typing <kbd>git</kbd>.
		If you do not have git already installed on your computer where you
   	intend to work you can download git for various platforms from the
   	official site: <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="alert alert-danger">
    <strong>On Windows</strong>, the rest of the course instructions expect you are using
		<strong>Git Bash</strong> from the git installation instead of the
		default Windows command prompt.
    On high resolution screens you probably want to make the Git Bash font
    bigger. Click at the top left corner to open the window menu.
    Adjust font size in properties.
  </p>
  <p class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>On OS X</strong>, running git may produce a message "Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires
    admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo". You should run <kbd>sudo git</kbd>
    once to activate the free program that comes bundled with the Xcode development
    environment.
  </p>

		<figcaption><em>Git BASH on Windows</em></figcaption>
	</figure>
  <p class="alert alert-warning">
		Many IDE or versioning programs can support git and you may use them on this
		course without support. We encourage you to learn git using command line
		which you can use in all environments and over remote connections. General
		help using a bash type command line can be found for example here
		<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal</a>
		and you can receive help at the exercise sessions.
	</p>

	<h3>2. Generate and set SSH key</h3>
  <p>
    To enable cloning your project to your local computer you need to add an
		SSH key to your GitLab profile. The following commands typed in to a
		terminal will create a new key pair and display the public key.
    (If you already have a key you are using somewhere else, you can use the
    existing one.)
	</p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>ssh-keygen -t rsa</strong>
  # ... you will receive a series of questions ...
  # Type <strong>[ENTER]</strong> to accept each default, really no changes unless you know why.
$ <strong>cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub</strong>
  # ... the public key encoded as characters prints out ...
  # In Git Bash use window menu: edit &gt; mark to copy the key to clipboard.</pre>
	<p>
		The public key is entered to your <a href="https://gitlab.rd.tut.fi/profile">GitLab profile</a>
		via "Add Public Key". The title is only for your own information.
	</p>

  <h3>3. Cloning a project</h3>
  <p>
		Now you are ready to clone your project on your local machine.
		You can copy your repository SSH address from the top of
		your repository home page. Choose a directory and type:
	</p>
	<pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>git clone git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:YOUR_USER_NAME/seitti2017.git</strong>

Cloning into 'seitti2017'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
...</pre>
	<p>
    This will authenticate you on the server with the SSH key you created in the
    previous step and create a folder with the name of <code>seitti2017</code> where the
    contents of your repository from your server are cloned. If you did not change
    directories in Git Bash look for <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\seitti2017</code>
		on your computer.
	</p>
  <p>
    For the next steps in the instructions change directory to seitti2017. Following
    will also lists the contents of your cloned work space.
  </p>
  <pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>cd seitti2017</strong>
$ <strong>ls</strong>
exercises       lectures       readme.md</pre>
  <p class="alert alert-warning">
		Note that GitLab also has a feature where you can download
    your project. If you download your project instead of cloning you will not
    be able to submit your exercises.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Solving The Exercise</h3>
  <p>Open up <code>exercises/01_tools/hello.html</code> on your favorite code editor... or if
    you don't have a code editor read
		<a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-smackdown-atom-vs-brackets-vs-light-table-vs-sublime-text/">review of editors</a> that are particularly
    well suited for this course. If you have no preferences
    <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> is a good choice that we can support.
  </p>

  <p>You are free to edit the hello.html file to test things out,
    it just needs to match following four criteria so you get the points
    from this exercise:
	</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Document hello.html will be valid html5</li>
    <li><code>content</code> attribute of the <code>meta</code> element with
      the <code>name</code> attribute <code>author</code> will be changed</li>
    <li>Content of <code>em</code> element with the <code>id</code> attribute
      <code>signature</code> will be changed</li>
    <li>The changed attribute and element content will be the same</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>5. Add, Commit and Push changes</h3>
  <div class="alert alert-danger">
    <strong>On windows</strong>, git will most likely complain about your user
    identity when you try to commit your changes. You should start this step
    by explaining who you are.
    <pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"</strong>
$ <strong>git config --global user.email emailname@student.tut.fi</strong></pre>
  </div>
  <p>
    After you've modified the hello.html file, you need to commit your
    modifications. First check the status of the project:</p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git status</strong>

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   exercises/01_tools/hello.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</pre>
  <p>
		To <em>stage</em> files for a commit you first need to <em>add</em> them.
		Note that add does not refer to adding a new file to your project but adding a file to a commit.
	</p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git add exercises/01_tools/hello.html</strong></pre>
  <p>
		Again you can check with git status that the file will be included in the
  	commit:
	</p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git status</strong>

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

      modified:   exercises/01_tools/hello.html</pre>
  <p>Now you can commit these changes to your repository with <kbd>git commit</kbd>.
    It will open a text editor where you can write
    a message for the commit that reflects the changes that you've done.
    You can also just type the commit message alongside the command with -m switch, for example:</p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git commit -m "Solved the first exercise"</strong>
[master ab66b8d] Solved the first exercise
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletion(-)</pre>
	<p class="alert alert-warning">
		On many bash systems the default editor is <strong>vim</strong>.
		While it is an awesome editor there is a learning curve.
		Hints of the day: <kbd>i</kbd> for insert mode. <kbd>Your message</kbd>
		<kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit insert mode. <kbd>:wq</kbd> write and quit.
	</p>
  <p>Now the commit is done and the changes you've made to the files that
    you committed are tracked in the repository history.
    You can verify this by command <kbd>git log</kbd>.The first entry should look
    something like this:</p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git log</strong>
commit 2b9c171c4f051cd46b5ce3d77141aaef5bfdce9a
Author: Firstname Lastname &lt;YOUR_USER_NAME@gitlab.rd.tut.fi&gt;
Date:   Sun Oct 12 19:01:29 2014 +0300

Solved the first exercise</pre>
  <p>
    What remains is pushing these changes to your repository in GitLab.
    This can be done with <kbd>git push</kbd>:
  </p>
  <pre>
$ <strong>git push origin master</strong>
Counting objects: 7, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 345 bytes, done.
Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@gitlab.rd.tut.fi:xxxxxxxx/seitti2017.git
eb2fdc8..ab66b8d  master -> master</pre>
  <p>If there were no errors the changes are now reflected in
    GitLab (you can browse your project's files if you want to verify this).
  </p>


  <h3>6. Submitting Your Project to TUT+</h3>

  <p>Submitting your solution is similar to the first exercise. Just copy and
    paste your GitLab project's URL to TUT+.</p>
